Education: Undergraduate Computer Engineering Student at RWTH Aachen, Germany 

Description:
**This is a repository containing personal projects that I built to develop my practical programming skills alongside the theoretical skills I learn at University. I apologize for the lack of attention for the appearance of the projects, but since I am mostly interested in the logical aspect I tend to not spend as much time with CSS.**

Current Projects:
- tutoring-command-line: Command-line based tutoring Platform written in **Python**, using a **MySQL** Database, coded for Harvard's CS50X course
- auction: Simple auctioning website, similar to Ebay, coded for Harvard's CS50W course using **HTML, CSS, Python with Django**
- traffic-simulation: Simple traffic simulation project that allows a user to simulate roads, crossings, cars and more. Coded in **C++** for a university project (That's why most file names and so on are in german). The graphical interface created using SimuServer is not entirely my work, a template was provided by the university. 

In Progress:
- Email client Frontend
